<h4 style = "text-align:center;">Equality of matrices</h4>
<p>Let A and B be two matrices. A and B are said to be equal if - <ol><li>order of both the matrices is same i.e., the number of rows and columns in A is equal to the number of rows and columns in B, and</li><li>each element of one matrix is equal to the corresponding element of the other matrix i.e., $a_i_j = b_i_j$.</li></ol><span style="font-weight:500;line-height:150%">Hence, we can say that the two matrices are equal if and only if one is duplicate of the other.<br />If order of two matrices is same, then, they are said to be <strong>comparable.</strong></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align:center">Sum of matrices</h4>
<p>Let A and B be two matrices of order m x n. Then, their sum $ A+B $ is defined as another matrix $ C $, such that any element of C is the sum of corresponding elements of A and B.<br>In similar manner, we can say $A-B$ is another matrix $C$, such that any element of C is the difference of the corresponding elements of A and B.<br> <span style="font-weight:600"> $C = A &plusmn; B = [ a_i_j &plusmn; b_i_j]$</span></p>
<p>e-g- $ A = [\table 1,8,9;2,3,4] $ and $ B =[\table 0,3,4;5,2,3] $ <br>Here, order of both A and B is 2 x 3. Hence they can be added.<br>$A+B = [\table 1+0,8+3,9+4;2+5,3+2,4+3]$ <br> $ = [\table 1,11,13;7,5,7]$<br> and $A-B = [\table 1-0,8-3,9-4;2-5,3-2,4-3]$ <br> 
$ = [\table \1,5,5;-3,1,1]$ </p>
<h4>Properties of com.har_asha.linearalgebra.Matrix Addition</h4>
<ol style = "list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li>com.har_asha.linearalgebra.Matrix Addition is commutative $$A+B = B+A$$</li>
<li>com.har_asha.linearalgebra.Matrix Addition is associative $$(A+B)+C = A+(B+C)$$</li>
</ol>
<h4 style="text-align:center">Scalar Multiplication of a matrix</h4>
<p>Let A be a given matrix and $k$ be any scalar number real or complex, then, $kA$ is the matrix in which each element of matrix A is multiplied by $k$ and is called scalar multiplication of $A$ with $k$.<br>e-g- If $A = [\table 2,3,1;5,2,4]$<br> then, $\4A = [\table 4.2,4.3,4.1;4.5,4.2,4.4]$<br>or $\4A = [\table 8,12,4;20,8,16]$ </p>
